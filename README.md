# SonarQube GitHub Plugin

This is a less intrusive fork of the original [SonarQube GitHub plugin](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-github).
It only reports issues as inline code comments (no summary report) and always sets the commit state to `SUCCESS`, regardless of the output from the SonarQube report.
